for this level , i didn't just connect to the SSH server , but i learned how to create one with this command "ssh-keygen -t rsa " and creatting the keys (public and a extra-password) , than you have to go an online web like digital ocean to make a real server and getting an ip adress to continue the work (not free)

the command used to connect to the ssh is " ssh bandit0@bandit....... -p 2220 " 
and then enter the password
